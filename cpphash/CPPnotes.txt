When creating classes in a *.h file and then another in classname.cpp file,
the following must take place:

In header file:				In classname file:

class myclass(){						

//function prototype			//function prototype definition
type myfunc(type value);		type myclass::myfunc(type value){
					
					}
}

The type (int, char, etc of the return value for the declaration must match
in both the header and classname.cpp file.

The type (int, char, etc of the parameters passed into the function,
AND the prototype variable names must also match, and exist in 
BOTH files.
